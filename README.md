# Autofill
  
The Autofill module makes it possible to autofill the values from one textfield
to another while typing. Once your field input was customized the autofill
functionality will be detached.

module. Visit https://www.drupal.org/node/1897420 for further information.

type.
2. Click on the widget settings icon for the field that should be autofilled.
3. Enable "Autofill from another field"
4. Select the source field from which the field should be autofilled.
